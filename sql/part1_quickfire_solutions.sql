-- Question 1: What was the first product sold in each month?

SELECT DISTINCT ON (DATE_TRUNC('month', ORDER_DATE))
    DATE_TRUNC('month', ORDER_DATE) AS sale_month,

    PRODUCT_CODE,
    CUSTOMER_NAME,
    SALES,
    PRODUCT_LINE

-- Question 2: Which products are common to the two customers who have spent the most in total?

WITH customer_totals AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMER_NAME, SUM(SALES) AS total_spent
    FROM sales_data 
    GROUP BY CUSTOMER_NAME

-- Question 3: Are there any months where the average monthly revenue decreased compared to the month before?

-- Question 4: What is the best-selling product line by total sales and how does it compare to others?

SELECT

        SUM(SALES) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(SALES)) OVER (),
        2
    ) AS percent_of_total

-- Question 5: Identify customers who ordered in three or more consecutive months.
